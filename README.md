# EEG-Based-BCI-System-to-Detect-Fingers-Movements
A system that adopts the brain-computer interface technology to control prosthetic fingers with the use of brain signals. To predict the movements of each finger, complex electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing algorithms should be applied to remove the outliers, extract features, and be able to handle separately the five human fingers.
A broef research paper is written on this and is in process for publication.
